You are given an array A of N positive integers and an integer K. Find the largest possible even sum of K elements at different positions in A.

Write a function:

```
public func solution(_ A : inout[Int], _ L : Int) -> Int
```

that, given an array A of N positive integers and positive integer K, returns the largest even sum of K elements. If there are no such K elements, return - 1
